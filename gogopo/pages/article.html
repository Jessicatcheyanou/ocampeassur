   ORCAPE is presently at the thresh hold to launch her first major project as soon as the enforcement letter from the ministry of Transports will be signed and made public, on the obligatory usage of the bi-modular system which consist of an electronic cap of identification and a tracking device to all taxis in the city of Yaound√© for the first phase. To this effect, a dateline will be included in the said letter to enable all taxi vehicle owners to get their taxi vehicles subscribe to the system before the date limit or else repressed by the forces of law and other.
 The project entitled The RATIONALISATION AND SECURISATION OF URBAN TRANPORT THROUGH TAXIS WITH GEOLOCALISATION EQUIPEMENTS AND ELCTRONIC CAP OF IDENTICATION will create 600 direct and 400 indirect jobs to Cameroonians. The said project will permit ORCAPE to reach her major objective which is to combat unemployment and poverty.
The project which on the other hand, will combat the persistent insecurity trends witnessed in the taxi sector through taxi vehicle theft, daily and nightly aggressions of taxi passengers, lost of important objects by taxi users and more will permit the safety of taxi passengers as they board to different destinations of the town just by simply retaining the short and three digits numbers incorporated on the electronic cap mounted on the top of the taxi vehicle. Moreover, in the case of any form of insecurity, lost or the passenger forgets any important object, the latter shall call immediately the RAPID INTERENTION BATTALION UNIT(ESIR) or the OPERATIONS CENTER OF THE CENTRE REGIONAL GENDARMERIE(COG).This follows conventions signed between the GENERAL DELEGATION FOR NATIONAL SECURITY(DGSN) and the SECRETARIAT OF STATE AT MINISTRY OF DEFENSE INCHARGE OF THE NATIONAL GENDARMERIE following introductory letters, addressed to them by the Ministry of Transports to assure repression in case of all forms of insecurity in the taxi domain.
